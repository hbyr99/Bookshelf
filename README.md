## About The Project
Welcome to Bookshelf! This is a simple physical book tracking app developed for Calvin's CS 336 Web Development class.
The app has not been deployed as a PWA, and some of the features are still a work in progress, namely Favorites and Wishlist, Password Reset, and hopefully deploying as a PWA.
